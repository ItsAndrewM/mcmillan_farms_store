            arbitration: (a) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or

            of a Party; (b) any Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations
            of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and (c)
            any claim for injunctive relief. If this provision is found to be
            illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate
            any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to
            be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a
            court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for
            jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal
            jurisdiction of that court.

            agreement and understanding between you and us. Our failure to
            exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Legal Terms

            Legal Terms operate to the fullest extent permissible by law. We may
            assign any or all of our rights and obligations to others at any
            time. We shall not be responsible or liable for any loss, damage,

            Terms is determined to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that
            provision or part of the provision is deemed severable from these

            result of these Legal Terms or use of the Services. You agree that
            these Legal Terms will not be construed against us by virtue of
            having drafted them. You hereby waive any and all defenses you may
            have based on the electronic form of these Legal Terms and the lack
            of signing by the parties hereto to execute these Legal Terms.
